# MNIST GAN Experiments

**Description:** Implementations of Vanilla GAN, Conditional GAN, DCGAN, StyleGAN, and CycleGAN using the MNIST dataset from Keras.

This repository contains simplified and easy-to-understand Python implementations of different types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It is designed for learning, experimentation, and hands-on practice with GAN architectures on the MNIST dataset.

## GANs Included

1. **Vanilla GAN**  
   Basic GAN with fully connected layers generating handwritten digits.

2. **Conditional GAN (C-GAN)**  
   Generates digits conditioned on labels, allowing control over the digit type.

3. **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)**  
   Uses convolutional layers for higher quality generated images.

4. **StyleGAN (simplified)**  
   Style-based GAN for exploring latent space and image style manipulation.

5. **CycleGAN (simplified)**  
   Unpaired image-to-image translation (experimental on MNIST).
